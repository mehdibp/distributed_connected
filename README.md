# Physics Informed Reinforcement Learning of Connective Behavior in Complex Systems

### Abstract- 

> The Internet of Things has permeated all areas of modern life. In industry, transportation, media, smart homes, etc., the need for secure connection of objects and equipment and interaction between them is felt more than ever. To have secure and reliable communication, a network must operate in a self-organized manner without the aid of a predetermined or centralized structure. One of the important applications of the decentralized or distributed Internet of Things is wireless communication in emergencies. The design of such networks is often faced with problems, the most important of which is to achieve and maintain effective connectivity to have reliable communications, while optimizing energy consumption. Here, a model for topology control of self-organizing IoT networks is presented to address the stated challenges. The proposed model uses the concept of the Hamiltonian function in classical mechanics. Its purpose is to adjust the topology and dynamics of the network so that a favorable connection is established and the least amount of energy is consumed.
